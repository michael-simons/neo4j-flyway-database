= Contributing to the Neo4j Ecosystem
:sectanchors:

At http://neo4j.com/[Neo4j], we develop our software in the open at
GitHub. This provides transparency for you, our users, and allows you to
fork the software to make your own additions and enhancements. We also
provide areas specifically for community contributions, in particular
the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib[neo4j-contrib] space.

There's an active https://community.neo4j.com/[Neo4j Online Community]
where we work directly with the community. If you're not already a
member, sign up!

We love our community and wouldn't be where we are without you. Please remember:
Many things are contributions, among them issues, code, documentation and examples.

== Building and compiling Neo4j-Flyway-Database

=== Full build

You need Java 17 to compile and package the binaries and Docker for testing:

[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
[[build-default-bash]]
.Full build and verification
----
$ ./mvnw clean verify
----

=== Fast build

This is useful if you want to just have an installation of a snapshot version. No tests are run, no verification is done.

[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
[[build-default-bash]]
.Fast build (only compiling and producing packages)
----
$ ./mvnw -Dfast package
----

=== Releasing (Only relevant for the current maintainers)

Releases will be created via standard Maven `release:prepare` / `release:perform` cycle.

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw release:prepare
./mvnw release:perform
----

==== Bumping minor or major versions

Use the provided script to bump the minor or major version:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/bump-version.sh 3.0
----

Version can be either a new major or minor version (such as 3, 3.0 etc.) or a fully qualified snapshot version (such as 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT).

== General considerations

=== Need to raise an issue?

Where you raise an issue depends largely on the nature of the problem.

Firstly, if you are an Enterprise customer, you might want to head over
to our http://support.neo4j.com/[Customer Support Portal].

There are plenty of public channels available too, though. If you simply
want to get started or have a question on how to use a particular
feature, ask a question in https://community.neo4j.com/[Neo4j Online
Community]. If you think you might have hit a bug in our software (it
happens occasionally!) or you have specific feature request then use the
issue feature on the relevant GitHub repository. Check first though as
someone else may have already raised something similar.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/neo4j[StackOverflow] also
hosts a ton of questions and might already have a discussion around your
problem. Make sure you have a look there too.

Include as much information as you can in any request you make:

* Which versions of our products are you using?
* Which language (and which version of that language) are you developing
with?
* What operating system are you on?
* Are you working with a cluster or on a single machine?
* What code are you running?
* What errors are you seeing?
* What solutions have you tried already?

=== Want to contribute?

It's easier for all of us if you try to follow these steps before creating a pull request:

* Do all your work in a personal fork of the original repository
* https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request[Rebase],
don't merge (we prefer to keep our history clean)
* Create a branch (with a useful name) for your contribution
* Make sure you're familiar with the appropriate coding style (this
varies by language so ask if you're in doubt)
* Include unit tests if appropriate (obviously not necessary for
documentation changes)

NOTE: Small things that doesn't change the public API or documented behaviour and of course bug fixes usually
go in quickly. If you want to add new features with public API changes or additions or want to customize or
change a feature, please do reach out to us on one of the available channels, preferable by creating a
https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/cypher-dsl/issues/new[new issue] first in which we can discuss the proposed changes.

We can't guarantee that we'll accept pull requests and may ask you to
make some changes before they go in. Occasionally, we might also have
logistical, commercial, or legal reasons why we can't accept your work,
but we'll try to find an alternative way for you to contribute in that
case. Remember that many community members have become regular
contributors and some are now even Neo employees!

== Got an idea for a new project?

If you have an idea for a new tool or library, start by talking to other
people in the community. Chances are that someone has a similar idea or
may have already started working on it. The best software comes from
getting like minds together to solve a problem. And we'll do our best to
help you promote and co-ordinate your Neo ecosystem projects.
